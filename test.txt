Subject: Clarification needed: Instance Scheduler behavior with SSM Maintenance Windows (start/stop across multiple windows)

Hi [TAM Name],

I’m seeking confirmation on the intended behavior of Instance Scheduler on AWS when using SSM Maintenance Windows.

Context (our test)

Two SSM Maintenance Windows in the same account/Region:

Patch Tuesday: 12:00–16:00

Patch Thursday: 12:00–16:00

Two EC2 instances, each targeted by a different window.

Both instances are tagged with the same schedule name (e.g., Schedule=0).

DynamoDB schedule config:

use_maintenance_window: true

ssm_maintenance_window: ["Patch-Tuesday-1200-1600","Patch-Thursday-1200-1600"]

Observed behavior

At Tuesday 12:01, both instances start, including the instance intended only for the Thursday window.

At the close of the Tuesday window, both instances stop as well (i.e., start/stop actions are applied to all instances sharing the schedule name, not just those targeted by the Tuesday window).

Expected behavior (our understanding of how it should work)

Normally, Instance Scheduler should evaluate the SSM Maintenance Window and start/stop only the instances that are members of that window’s target set. In other words, when the Tuesday window is active, only the instance targeted by Tuesday should be started/stopped, and the Thursday-targeted instance should remain unaffected.

Request for confirmation

Please confirm whether Instance Scheduler, when use_maintenance_window is enabled, does not check the SSM Maintenance Window’s registered targets and instead applies start/stop actions to all instances that share the schedule name whenever any of the listed windows is active.

If that is the intended design, we will adjust our rollout (e.g., one schedule per window or other segmentation) to avoid cross-start/stop behavior.
